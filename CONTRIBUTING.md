## Reporting bugs and opening issues

If you'd like a report a bug or open an issue then please:

**Check if there is an existing issue.** If there is then please add
   any more information that you have, or give it a 👍.

When submitting an issue please describe the issue as clearly as possible, including how to
reproduce the bug, which situations it appears in, what you expected to happen, and what actually happens.
If you can include a screenshot for front end issues that is very helpful.

## Coding Guidelines

### Pull Requests
We love pull requests, so be bold with them! Don't be afraid of going ahead
and changing something, or adding a new feature. We're very happy to work with you
to get your changes merged into Trianglify.

If you've got an idea for a change then please discuss it in the open first, 
either by opening an issue, or by joining us in our
[MDG public chat room](https://mdg.sdslabs.co/chat).

If you're looking for something to work on, have a look at the open issues in the repository [here](https://github.com/sdsmdg/FLASTO/issues).

#### Pull Request Process
 1. Always work on your own fork of the repository and open pull requests when necessary.
 1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
 1. When working on a bug/issue , open a pull request as soon as you start working and mark
 it as `[WIP]` (Work in Progress), so that the developers can keep an eye on the work going on.
 1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, new android permissions , useful file locations and container parameters.
 1. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.
 1. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## MDG Chat Room

If you want to ask any questions in real-time, or get a feel for what's going on
then please drop into our [MDG public chat room](https://mdg.sdslabs.co/chat).
If no one is online then you can still leave a message that will hopefully get a reply
when we return.

## Security

Please do not publish security vulnerabilities publicly until we've had a chance
to address them. All security related issues/patches should be sent directly to
[sdsmobilelabs@gmail.com](mailto:sdsmobilelabs@gmail.com) where we will attempt to address them quickly. If you're
unsure whether something is a security issue or not, then please be cautious and contact us at [sdsmobilelabs@gmail.com](mailto:sdsmobilelabs@gmail.com) first.
